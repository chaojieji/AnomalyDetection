# A model used for the detection of soil particles in small biomass particles with visible light spectrometry and GAN algorithm

## Abstract 

One challenge in the utilization of woody biomass is its high ash content in some size fractions. Smaller particle sizes often had higher ash content. So far, the sources of this higher ash content have not been identified. Our hypothesis is that the smaller particles contain a higher percentage of soil particles and bark particles than larger-sized particles. In this study, we apply digital light microscopy and visible spectrophotometer to identify the sources of ash content. We then applied Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to explore the possibility of detecting soil particles through machine visions.
